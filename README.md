PlainTasks Markdown Theme
============================

A Markdown inspired theme for [PlainTasks](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks).

There are not many [PlainTask](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks)-themes out there. As a [MarkdownEditing](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing) fan I wanted to create a similar light theme and here it is!

(oh yeah, some colors are from [Flat UI Colors](http://flatuicolors.com/)).

## Installation

On a Mac, go to `Sublime Text → Preferences → Browse Packages` and drop the `tasks-markdown.hidden-tmTheme` file to root folder. Then open the PlainTasks-Settings by going to `Sublime Text → Package Settings → PlainTasks → Settings – User` and paste the contents of the `PlainTasks.sublime-settings`-file into it.

Restart Sublime Text and you are ready to roll.
